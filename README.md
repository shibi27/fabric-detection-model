## 📌 Overview

**Fabric Detection using CNN** is a deep learning–based computer vision module developed for a smart automatic ironing machine.  
The system automatically identifies the **type of fabric from an image** and enables **intelligent control of ironing temperature and steam**, reducing fabric damage and improving safety.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Manual ironing often leads to:
- Incorrect temperature selection  
- Fabric damage and wrinkles  
- Safety risks and inefficiency  

There is a need for an **intelligent, automated solution** that can **identify fabric types accurately** and assist in smart ironing.

---

## 💡 Solution

This project uses a **lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify fabric images based on **texture and surface patterns**.  
The model is optimized for **real-time and embedded deployment**.

---

## 🧶 Supported Fabric Classes

The final optimized model classifies the following **4 fabrics**:

- 🧺 Cotton  
- 👖 Denim  
- 🪡 Silk  
- 🧵 Nylon
